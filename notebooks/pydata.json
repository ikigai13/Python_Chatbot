Similarly, the second specification is {1} corresponding to age which is the second argument to the format method. Note that Python starts counting from 0 which means that first position is at index 0, second position is at index 1, and so on.\nNotice that we could have achieved the same using string concatenation:\nname + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old' but that is much uglier and more error-prone. Second, the conversion to string would be done automatically by the format method instead of the explicit conversion to strings needed in this case. Third, when using the format method, we can change the message without having to deal with the variables used and vice-versa.

Then, we check if the guess is less than the number, and if so, we inform the user that they must guess a little higher than that. What we have used here is the elif clause which actually combines two related if else-if else statements into one combined if-elif-else statement. This makes the program easier and reduces the amount of indentation required.\nThe elif and else statements must also have a colon at the end of the logical line followed by their corresponding block of statements (with proper indentation, of course)\nYou can have another if statement inside the if-block of an if statement and so on - this is called a nested if statement.

In this case, it is one of the built-in modules, and hence Python knows where to find it.\nIf  it  was  not  a  compiled  module  i.e.  a  module  written  in  Python,  then  the  Python  interpreter  will  search  for  it  in  the directories listed in its sys.path variable. If the module is found, then the statements in the body of that module are run and the module is made available for you to use. Note that the initialization is done only the first time that we import a module.\nThe argv variable in the sys module is accessed using the dotted notation i.e. sys.argv .

We remove the variable/attribute of the current module using the del statement and the change is reflected again in the output of the dir function.\nA note on del : This statement is used to delete a variable/name and after the statement has run, in this case del a , you can no longer access the variable a - it is as if it never existed before at all.\nNote that the dir() function works on any object. For example, run dir(str) for the attributes of the str (string) class.\nThere is also a vars() function which can potentially give you the attributes and their values, but it will not work for all cases."

We will explore this topic in detail in a later chapter.\nA list is an example of usage of objects and classes. When we use a variable i and assign a value to it, say integer 5 to it, you can think of it as creating an object (i.e. instance) i of class (i.e. type) int . In fact, you can read help(int) to understand this better.\nA class can also have methods i.e.  functions defined for use with respect to that class only. You can use these pieces of functionality only when you have an object of that class. For example, Python provides an append method for the list class which allows you to add an item to the end of the list. For example, mylist.append('an item') will add that string to the list mylist . Note the use of dotted notation for accessing methods of the objects."

If the first number is not specified, Python will start at the beginning of the sequence. If the second number is left out, Python will stop at the end of the sequence. Note that the slice returned starts at the start position and will end just before the end position i.e. the start position is included but the end position is excluded from the sequence slice.\nThus, shoplist[1:3] returns a slice of the sequence starting at position 1, includes position 2 but stops at position 3 and therefore a slice of two items is returned. Similarly, shoplist[:] returns a copy of the whole sequence.\nYou can also do slicing with negative positions. Negative numbers are used for positions from the end of the sequence.

If you just assign the variable name to another name, both of them will ''refer'' to the same object and this could be trouble if you are not careful.\nNote for Perl programmers\nRemember that an assignment statement for lists does not create a copy.

When we observe the error given by Python, it also tells us the place where it detected the error as well. So we start debugging our program from that line.\nOn careful observation, we see that the single logical line has been split into two physical lines but we have not specified that these two physical lines belong together. Basically, Python has found the addition operator ( + ) without any operand in that logical line and hence it doesn't know how to continue. Remember that we can specify that the logical line continues in the next physical line by the use of a backslash at the end of the physical line. So, we make this correction to our program. This correction of the program when we find errors is called bug fixing ."

This is called the object oriented programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques.\nClasses and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.\nNote for Static Language Programmers\nNote that even integers are treated as objects (of the int class). This is unlike C++ and Java (before version 1.5) where integers are primitive native types.\nSee help(int) for more details on the class.\nC# and Java 1.5 programmers will find this similar to the boxing and unboxing concept."

For example, when you call `myobject.my_method(5)`, it internally converts to `MyClass.my_method(myobject, 5)` which enables the method to use the `value` attribute of `myobject`. This mechanism ensures that each method has access to its own instance data."

When you call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2) , this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) - this is all the special self is about.\nThis also means that if you have a method which takes no arguments, then you still have to have one argument the self ."

        "question": "Why does Python print a memory address when you print an object?",

This is followed by an indented block of statements which form the body of the class. In this case, we have an empty block which is indicated using the pass statement.\nNext, we create an object/instance of this class using the name of the class followed by a pair of parentheses. (We will learn more about instantiation in the next section). For our verification, we confirm the type of the variable by simply printing it. It tells us that we have an instance of the Person class in the __main__ module.\nNotice that the address of the computer memory where your object is stored is also printed.

Also note that an object variable with the same name as a class variable will hide the class variable!\nInstead of Robot.population , we could have also used self.__class__.population because every object refers to its class via the self.__class__ attribute.\nThe how_many is actually a method that belongs to the class and not to the object. This means we can define it as either a classmethod or a staticmethod depending on whether we need to know which class we are part of.

In this method, we increase the population count by 1 since we have one more robot being added. Also observe that the values of self.name is specific to each object which indicates the nature of object variables.\nRemember, that you must refer to the variables and methods of the same object using the self only . This is called an attribute reference .\nIn this program, we also see the use of docstrings for classes as well as methods. We can access the class docstring at runtime using Robot.__doc__ and the method docstring as Robot.say_hi.__doc__ In the die method, we simply\ndecrease the Robot.population count by 1."

One exception: If you use data members with names using the double underscore prefix such as __privatevar , Python uses name-mangling to effectively make it a private variable.\nThus, the convention followed is that any variable that is to be used only within the class or object should begin with an underscore and all other names are public and can be used by other classes/objects.

We can also provide a third argument that determines the step by which the slicing is done. The default step is 1 because of which it returns a continuous part of the text. Giving a negative step, i.e., -1 will return the text in reverse.\nThe input() function takes a string as argument and displays it to the user. Then it waits for the user to type something and press the return key. Once the user has entered and pressed the return key, the input() function will then return that text the user has entered.\nWe take that text and reverse it.

The difference here is that we are using the open function with the with statement - we leave the closing of the file to be done automatically by with open .\nWhat happens behind the scenes is that there is a protocol used by the with statement. It fetches the object returned by the open statement, let's call it \"thefile\" in this case.\nIt always calls the thefile.__enter__ function before starting the block of code under it and always calls thefile.__exit__\nafter finishing the block of code.\nSo the code that we would have written in a finally block should be taken care of automatically by the __exit__ method.

If it is Windows, we figure out the home drive, the home folder and the filename where we want to store the information. Putting these three parts together, we get the full location of the file. For other platforms, we need to know just the home folder of the user and we get the full location of the file.\nWe use the os.path.join() function to put these three parts of the location together. The reason to use a special function rather than just adding the strings together is because this function will ensure the full location matches the format expected by the operating system.

The following example should make this clear:\n```\n>>> flag = True >>> if flag: print('Yes') ... Yes\n```\nNotice that the single statement is used in-place and not as a separate block.

        "question": "What is the purpose of Python decorators?",
        "answer": "Python decorators are a design pattern that allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their structure. Example code: @my_decorator\ndef my_function(): pass"
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I use a decorator in Python to add functionality to a function?",
        "answer": "You define a decorator by creating a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function. For example:\n\n```\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        func()\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n    return wrapper\n```\n\nThen, you can apply this decorator to a function like so: `@my_decorator\ndef say_hello(): print('Hello')`"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you give an example of how decorators are used in real Python code?",
        "answer": "Certainly! Here\u2019s an example where we use the `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata when using a decorator:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import wraps\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print('Hello')\nsay_hello()  # Output: Something is happening before the function is called. Hello Something is happening after the function is called."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are some common examples of Python decorators used in practice?",
        "answer": "Common examples include decorators like `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`. For instance, you can use a custom decorator to time how long it takes for a function to execute:\n\n```python\ndef timer(func):\n    import time\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds to execute.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n@timer\ndef example_function():\n    import time\n    time.sleep(1)\nexample_function()  # Output: Function example_function took 1.00 seconds to execute."

      {
        "question": "How do I apply multiple decorators in Python?",
        "answer": "You can apply multiple decorators to a function by placing them above the function definition, with the outermost decorator at the top and inner ones below.
