# Python Chatbot

This is my first project on building an NLP/LLM-based chatbot model.  
The process starts with creating a synthetic dataset, then training the model using LoRA.  
It has two main parts:  

1. **Synthetic Data Creation & training the model** – using Colab and local tools (Ollama, Transformers, TRL, PEFT, etc.).  

2. **Web Application** – built with Flask, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

    python app.py
